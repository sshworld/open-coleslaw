# Open Coleslaw

Multi-agent orchestrator plugin for Claude Code.

## Architecture
- 3-tier hierarchy: Orchestrator (proxy) -> Leaders (team leads) -> Workers (executors)
- MCP Server over stdio transport + Claude Code plugin (skills, hooks, agents)
- SQLite storage at ~/.open-coleslaw/data.db
- Web dashboard at http://localhost:35143
- Claude CLI subprocess for agent execution (mock mode with COLESLAW_MOCK=1)

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript (strict, ESM)
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk -- MCP server
- better-sqlite3 -- storage
- ws -- WebSocket for dashboard
- zod -- validation
- tsup -- build
- vitest -- testing

## Build & Run
- `npm run build` -- build with tsup
- `npm run dev` -- watch mode
- `npm test` -- vitest (219 tests)
- `npm run lint` -- tsc --noEmit
- `npm run clean` -- remove dist/

```

## MCP Tools (15 registered)
1. `start-meeting` -- Convene a meeting (`kickoff` | `design` | `verify-retry`) with a topic + agenda
2. `get-meeting-status` -- Get meeting progress and agent states
3. `get-minutes` -- Retrieve PRD-format meeting minutes
4. `execute-tasks` -- Return the task list directly from `minutes.actionItems` for worker dispatch
5. `get-agent-tree` -- Display the full agent hierarchy tree (bookkeeping)
6. `respond-to-mention` -- Respond to a pending @mention decision
7. `get-mentions` -- List @mentions filtered by status/meeting
8. `cancel-meeting` -- Cancel a meeting with cascade to all workers
9. `list-meetings` -- List meetings with status filter and pagination
10. `get-task-report` -- Execution report with per-department breakdown
11. `create-capability` -- Self-extend: create new hook/skill/command/asset/loop
12. `get-cost-summary` -- Cost tracking per agent/meeting/department
13. `chain-meeting` -- Link meetings: output of one feeds into the next
14. `add-transcript` -- Record a speaker's turn during a meeting
15. `generate-minutes` -- Write PRD minutes from the accumulated transcripts

## Agent Tiers
| Tier | Model | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Orchestrator | claude-opus-4-6 (1M) | Full-picture routing, delegation, MVP cycles |
| Leader | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Meetings, technical decisions, consensus stance |
| Worker (impl) | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Code, implementation |
| Worker (research) | claude-haiku-4-5 | Quick lookups |

Specialist leader roles: `planner`, `architect`, `engineer`, `verifier`, `product-manager`, `researcher`.

## Departments & Allowed Tools
- **Planning**: Read (planner always attends; facilitates, doesn't take positions)
- **Architecture**: Read, Grep, Glob
- **Engineering**: Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Edit, Bash
- **Verification**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (formerly QA; now also runs verification after implementation)
- **Product**: Read
- **Research**: Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch

## Conventions
- ESM imports with .js extensions
- All timestamps: Date.now() (Unix ms)
- JSON fields in SQLite: serialize/deserialize in store functions
- Conventional commits: feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore
- Agent system prompts include core rules from rules.md
- Mock mode: set COLESLAW_MOCK=1 for development without Claude CLI
- Node.js >= 18 required

## Key Decisions
- Orchestrator is user's proxy/delegate, NOT CEO
- Kickoff meeting breaks user request into ordered MVPs before any design meeting
- Meetings terminate on **consensus**, not round count (MAX_ROUNDS=10 escalates to @mention)
- Planner always attends; facilitates and synthesizes, doesn't take technical positions
- Dynamic attendee selection — not every specialist attends every meeting
- Workers spawned on-demand by the orchestrator (Agent tool), destroyed after task completion
- Minutes saved to project's `docs/open-coleslaw/` with INDEX.md (per-project, survives compact/clear)
- Dashboard renders a **meeting thread + comments UI**; browser comments flow through a file queue
- Stop hook checks context usage at cycle end (`.cycle-complete` marker) and suggests `/compact` or `/clear` above ~30%
- Self-extending: creates new capabilities on demand
- Rule priority: rules.md > CLAUDE.md > conversation context
- MVP cycle: kickoff -> (per MVP: design -> plan -> workers -> verify -> fail? verify-retry)
